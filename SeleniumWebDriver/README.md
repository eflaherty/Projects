# How to run C# tests using Selenium Web Driver

## Prerequisites: 
A .csproj file exists in the project directory. This can be created by setting up a new project in VS Code or manually setting it up. To manually setup the project, the *.csproj file can be copied from another project and renamed to the current project's name (SpecialElements.csproj).

## Navigate to the project directory, i.e., SetupYourEnv.

### Run the build and the tests.

-  dotnet clean
-  dotnet build
-  **dotnet run**
