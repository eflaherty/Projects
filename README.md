PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I have worked in the software industry for over 10 years gaining valuable multidisciplinary experience resulting in robust manual and automated testing strategies, cross-functional teams collaboration, knowledge of microservices and client/server architecture. I have a proven track record of motivating and leading software testing teams, managing test assets, and working with distributed engineering and product teams across different continents to drive continuous improvement and identify process enhancements. Highly skilled in requirements analysis, test strategy, and test planning. Deeply engaged in all stages of product, development, and test life cycle with a growth and forward-thinking mindset.

I have valuable experience researching existing documentation, working with product, design, and development teams to compile test plans and test strategies for web-based, desktop, and mobile applications both separately and the entire ecosystem.
